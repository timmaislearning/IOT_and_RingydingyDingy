For toilet lid sensing, put an infrared or other sensor from the side of the toilet at the height of where the lid would be if up so that the lid break the sigal if up.  Also, another sensor would be needed for sensing feet or calves or something to detect when someone approaches to not keep the light on all night.  Maybe a low chime in addition to a red light for when lid is up and someone approaches, during tired times.
